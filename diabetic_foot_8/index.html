ulceration and tissue loss Diabetic foot disease affects just under 6% of people with diabetes Foot ulceration increases an individuals risk of infection and amputation Complications can be prevented with good foot care and screening These patients require a multi disciplinary team to provide comprehensive care to prevent these complication  Causes  Types of diabetic foot ulcers include:  Neuropathic – secondary to peripheral neuropathy Ischaemic – secondary to peripheral arterial disease Mixed – a combination of neuropathic and ischaemic Peripheral arterial disease Diabetes causes damages to blood vessels by inflammation and atherosclerosis. Peripheral arterial disease is associated with slower healing of ulcers Diabetic peripheral neuropathy High blood sugar damages the sensory, motor and autonomic nerves With reduced sensation, individuals may develop a cut on their foot and not be aware. Poorly fitting shoes may cause blistering and subsequent ulceration. There will be delayed healing, and wounds may become infected. Motor weakness may change an individual’s gait. This creates pressure areas on the foot, predisposing to ulceration. It can also lead to the development of calluses and foot deformities such as hammer toe and claw toe, which increase the risk of ulceration.    Risk Factors  Non modifiable: age; male gender Modifiable: Smoking; poor glycaemic control; previous ulceration; insulin dependent diabetics; multisystem diabetic pathology  Presentation  Individuals may lack the typical symptoms of peripheral arterial disease, such as intermittent claudication or rest pain Diabetic ulcers may be discovered on inspection. The affected area will be erythematous and swollen and may have an odour if infected  Examination  Inspection: Look between the toes and on the posterior surface of the legs to check for ulcers Palpation: pulses from femoral down to pedal pulses Palpation: check sensation with a monofilament to assess for a peripheral neuropathy. Sensation may also be tested for vibration, proprioception and temperature Additional investigations: BM; HbA1c Additional assessment: peripheral arterial examination; lower limb neurological examination  Investigations  Clinical examination to confirm neuropathy Bloods tests to assess diabetic control: BM and HbA1c Wound swabs/soft tissue sample of ulcer to assess for infection X-ray if suspect osteomyelitis. Consider an MRI if clinical suspicion is high and the x-ray is inconclusive ABPI +/- duplex ultrasound to assess for peripheral arterial disease Further arterial imaging if required (CT angiography, DS angiography)  Management - Prevention  Patient education to: assess feet daily; perform basic foot care; maintain a healthy diet and exercise; stop smoking Annual foot assessments in the community Optimise glycaemic control Refer individuals to a specialist multidisciplinary foot care service if any evidence of neuropathy, deformity, ischaemia, ulceration or previous amputation  Treatment  Wound care of ulcers with dressings Offloading footwear to protect pressure areas Antibiotics for diabetic foot infection should be commenced as soon as possible. Aim to take microbiology samples before therapy Debridement to remove non viable tissue and to obtain a tissue sample for directed antibiotic therapy Re-vascularisation if ulceration is secondary to peripheral arterial disease Amputation  Outcomes  Diabetic foot can be prevented by patient education, regular foot assessment, appropriate footwear, glycaemic control, and early referral Diabetic foot ulcers may cause cellulitis, infected foot ulcers and osteomyelitis Individuals with diabetes and a foot/ankle fracture are at risk of Charcot arthropathy Up to 1.5% of individuals with diabetic foot will require an amputation  Resources  https://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j5064 https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng19/chapter/Recommendations#diabetic-foot-problems  Home ","wordCount":"546","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://daviddykeuk.github.io/lucinda/diabetic_foot_8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Lucinda's tests","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://daviddykeuk.github.io/lucinda/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://daviddykeuk.github.io/lucinda/ accesskey=h title="Lucinda's tests (Alt + H)">Lucinda's tests</a>
